# Academic Policies and Procedures FAQ

Q: What are the important academic policies I need to know?
A: You should familiarize yourself with the Academic Calendar (tables of term dates, add/drop deadlines, withdrawal dates), the Attendance Policy, Evaluation Rules, the Academic Integrity Policy, Grade Dispute and Appeal policy, Academic Standing guidelines, and program-specific requirements. These are accessible on the Registrar's Office and Conestoga Student Success sites, and they govern enrollment, grading, participation, and academic conduct.

Q: Where can I find the official Academic Calendar?
A: The Academic Calendar is published online each academic year on the Conestoga Academic Calendar page. It includes term start and end dates, exam schedules, cut-off dates for registration, and official holidays such as Family Day, Victoria Day, Thanksgiving, and winter breaks.

Q: How do I add or drop a course?
A: To add or drop a course, go to the Student Portal during the add/drop period for your term. You must complete add/drop forms and submit them by the designated deadline to avoid incurring full tuition or academic penalty. If you miss the deadline, a “W” (Withdrawal) appears on your transcript and may affect your GPA.

Q: What does “withdrawal with refund” mean?
A: Withdrawal with refund allows you to drop a course and receive a partial or full refund, depending on when you withdraw. A refund may require administrative processing and must occur before the refund deadline; review the Academic Calendar for dates.

Q: What if I withdraw after the refund deadline?
A: Late withdrawals result in a “W” on your transcript but no refund. The course remains recorded. Repeated “W”s may impact academic standing or program eligibility.

Q: What is the attendance policy?
A: Conestoga expects regular attendance and active participation in class, labs, clinicals, practicums, and placements. Faculty may assign grades based partly on attendance; skipping classes can result in reduced grades or academic penalties. Contact your instructor and SSA if illness or emergency prevents attendance.

Q: How do I get accommodations for religious observances or academic situations?
A: You must submit a request in writing to your instructor before the mandatory event or evaluation. Supporting documentation may be required. The instructor and SSA will collaborate to schedule an alternate date or format, if possible. Personal conflicts like vacations or social events are generally not accommodated.

Q: What are the evaluation policies?
A: Evaluation policies differ by faculty, course, and program, and may include exams, quizzes, assignments, presentations, labs, group work, and participation components. Marks are usually communicated through the Student Portal or instructor email. All major evaluations are scheduled in advance via the Academic Calendar.

Q: What happens if I miss an exam or major evaluation?
A: You must notify your instructor or SSC administrative office ASAP, ideally before the evaluation starts. Provide documentation (such as a doctor’s note) as soon as possible. Faculty will then determine if a make‑up exam or alternate evaluation is appropriate. Without documentation, a zero may be assigned.

Q: How does the Academic Integrity policy work?
A: Academic integrity means honesty and ethical behavior in all academic assignments. Examples of violations include plagiarism, cheating, falsification of data, unauthorized collaboration, and reuse of assignments. Consequences range from failing the activity to failing the course or academic suspension, depending on severity.

Q: What should I do if I'm told I may have breached academic integrity?
A: You will receive a meeting request from your Faculty, SSA or Student Rights & Responsibilities (SRRO) Office. Attend the meeting, review the evidence, present your perspective, and accept responsibility or appeal. Appeal deadlines are outlined in the policy.

Q: How can I avoid unintentional plagiarism?
A: Use proper citations in accepted formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.). Paraphrase carefully and track sources. Writing Services offers support in structuring citations and paraphrasing without misrepresenting sources.

Q: What is academic standing?
A: Academic standing reflects your overall academic performance. Good standing is typically a GPA of 2.0 or higher (or program minimum). Falling below that can result in being on Academic Warning or Academic Probation, with limited enrollment and mandatory advising.

Q: What should I do if I'm placed on Academic Probation?
A: Meet with your SSA promptly. Develop an academic improvement plan—set weekly study goals, attend learning labs and workshops, seek tutoring, adjust course load, and evaluate learning strategies. Follow up continuously and seek tutoring or career support to avoid further consequences.

Q: How do I dispute a grade?
A: Start by discussing the grade with your instructor. If the outcome is unsatisfactory, you can escalate your appeal to the Program Chair within 10 business days of grade release. Provide a covering letter detailing the request, your rationale, and relevant course materials.

Q: What is the grade appeal procedure?
A: The Grade Appeal process has three stages. Stage 1 is a formal appeal to the Instructor within the deadline. Stage 2 involves the Program Chair or similar, and Stage 3 is final appeal to the Vice President Academic. Appeals at Stage 3 can result in decisions being reconsidered or final.

Q: Are final grades ever changed?
A: Grades can be reviewed after appeal, new evidence emerges, or clerical errors are found. Once final, they remain on your transcript; if revised, updated transcripts are issued.

Q: How do I withdraw from my program?
A: To withdraw program-wide, complete the required withdrawal form in the Student Portal. Discuss your decision with your SSA to explore alternatives. Withdraw before withdrawal dates to avoid academic penalties.

Q: Will withdrawing affect my OSAP?
A: Yes. If you withdraw part-time or full-time, OSAP funding may be recalculated according to the number of credits completed. You may be required to repay a portion of funding.

Q: What is the makeup policy for labs or practical sessions?
A: Lab time is limited and cannot always be repeated. Notify the instructor immediately to schedule a makeup or alternate assignment. Documentation is required. Some practical activities cannot be made up; alternatives are decided at faculty discretion.

Q: What if I need special exam accommodations for accessibility or religious reasons?
A: Submit accommodation documentation through Accessible Learning at least three weeks before the exam. Accommodated settings, extra time, or alternate formats may be arranged.

Q: Where are the Academic Policies located?
A: All academic policies and procedures are on the Registrar’s Office site, your program’s Moodle page, and Student Success Portal. Each course syllabus should also list relevant policy references.

Q: Is it mandatory to follow the student code of conduct?
A: Yes. You agree to abide by the Student Code of Conduct when you register. Infraction results fall under the Student Rights & Responsibilities process and may include sanctions from warnings to suspension.

Q: What support is available if I struggle academically?
A: Utilize Learning Skills workshops, drop-in tutoring, Math & Writing labs, peer mentor teams, Academic Coaching, and one-to-one SSA academic planning. You are encouraged to access supports early.

Q: How do I find policy deadlines?
A: Deadlines for course changes, withdrawals, exam appeals, etc., are listed in the Academic Calendar and each course syllabus. Review deadlines at the start of each term, and keep a personal calendar.

Q: Who should I contact with unanswered academic policy questions?
A: For general policy clarity, contact your SSA or Faculty Administrative Assistant. For hearings related to integrity or wardrobe, contact SRRO. For registrar-specific timelines, contact the Registrar’s Office.

Q: What happens if I miss an important deadline?
A: Late submissions may receive a penalty or no credit. Missing add/drop or withdrawal deadlines results in being responsible for tuition or failing grade. Contact your SSA quickly to discuss options; internal appeals can sometimes be made.

Q: Can I get an extension on assignments?
A: Extensions are granted at instructor discretion. Submit extension requests before deadlines with reason (e.g., illness, caregiving). Documented reasons may be approved; faculty determine extensions and penalties.

Q: Does the College allow repeating a course?
A: In many programs, you may repeat a failed course. Check your program requirements. GPA recalculation and transcript may list repeats. Financial aid eligibility for repeats is subject to OSAP rules.

Q: How do I register for repeat courses?
A: You must register during regular registration windows by searching for the course code. Contact your SSA or Registrar’s Office for registration assistance.

Q: Can repeated courses impact my GPA?
A: Depends on policy. At Conestoga, all attempts appear on your transcript, but GPA calculation may consider only the highest grade, according to Academic Calendar.

Q: What counts as academic misconduct?
A: Academic misconduct includes plagiarism, cheating, falsifying data/labs, improper collaboration, sharing answers, submitting same work for different courses. The SRRO investigates allegations and prescribes penalties.

Q: Who manages academic misconduct issues?
A: The Student Rights & Responsibilities Office investigates. Faculty and Program Chairs support information gathering. Appeals must be directed within 10 business days of initial decisions.

Q: How can I avoid being accused of misconduct?
A: Keep academic integrity in mind—cite all sources, work individually when instructions say so, keep assignment drafts, reference lab logs accurately, don't share answers or login info.

Q: Are there student workshops on policies?
A: Yes, Student Success runs webinars and drop-in sessions explaining academic policies, integrity, and support services. Watch the Student Success Events Calendar.

Q: What is a “Dean’s List” or Honor Roll?
A: Depending on program criteria, students with high academic performance (e.g., GPA ≥ 3.5 and minimum credit load) are recognized each semester. Outstanding students are announced and may receive certificates.

  
# Attendance and Evaluations FAQ

A: Attendance ensures you access all course content, group activities, labs, testing instructions, and key learning moments. Many courses use participation or professionalism in grading. Missing classes may harm performance and may result in being dropped from the course.

Q: Are online classes treated differently?
A: Attendance is still required—log into synchronous sessions or complete asynchronous modules. Faculty may track participation. Login frequency and assignment submissions count as attendance.

Q: What if I'm sick?
A: Notify your instructor immediately and provide documentation (doctor’s note). Ask how you can make up missed content. Submit notes within timelines; faculty determine makeup options. If serious illness persists, discuss temporary leave with your SSA.

Q: What if it's a personal or family emergency?
A: Notify your instructor ASAP. Provide documentation such as obituary, funeral notice, or hospital records. Faculty may offer alternative timelines. Contact your SSA for further support.

Q: How are missed labs or workshops handled?

Q: Can I request accommodations based on religious observances?
A: Yes. Inform your instructor in writing ahead of time. Document the religious dates and request alternate arrangements. Faculty try to accommodate within reason; if denied, escalate via SSA or SRRO.

A: Notify instructor or administrative office immediately, provide documentation, and request a deferred exam. The format, timing, and location of the deferred exam will be arranged at the discretion of the department.

Q: Can I reschedule assignments?

A: Contact Accessible Learning to submit required documentation. Accommodation could include extra time for exams, assistive technology, or alternative formats. After processing, you'll receive an Accommodation Letter to show your instructor at the start of term.
