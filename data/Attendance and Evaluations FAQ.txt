# Attendance and Evaluations FAQ

Q: Why is attendance important?
A: Attendance ensures you access all course content, group activities, labs, testing instructions, and key learning moments. Many courses use participation or professionalism in grading. Missing classes may harm performance and may result in being dropped from the course.

Q: Are online classes treated differently?
A: Attendance is still required—log into synchronous sessions or complete asynchronous modules. Faculty may track participation. Login frequency and assignment submissions count as attendance.

Q: What if I'm sick?
A: Notify your instructor immediately and provide documentation (doctor’s note). Ask how you can make up missed content. Submit notes within timelines; faculty determine makeup options. If serious illness persists, discuss temporary leave with your SSA.

Q: What if it's a personal or family emergency?
A: Notify your instructor ASAP. Provide documentation such as obituary, funeral notice, or hospital records. Faculty may offer alternative timelines. Contact your SSA for further support.

Q: How are missed labs or workshops handled?
A: Labs often involve group work, special equipment, or safety protocols. Faculty may allow you to attend an alternate session or complete an alternate assignment. Some labs cannot be made up; consult faculty and your SSA for alternatives.

Q: Can I request accommodations based on religious observances?
A: Yes. Inform your instructor in writing ahead of time. Document the religious dates and request alternate arrangements. Faculty try to accommodate within reason; if denied, escalate via SSA or SRRO.

Q: What if I miss a test?
A: Notify instructor or administrative office immediately, provide documentation, and request a deferred exam. The format, timing, and location of the deferred exam will be arranged at the discretion of the department.

Q: Can I reschedule assignments?
A: Submission timelines are set at the beginning of each course. For legitimate reasons (e.g., documented illness, work requirements with notice, or OSAP review), faculty may grant extensions. Requests must have documentation and be made before deadline.

Q: How do I request academic accommodation?
A: Contact Accessible Learning to submit required documentation. Accommodation could include extra time for exams, assistive technology, or alternative formats. After processing, you'll receive an Accommodation Letter to show your instructor at the start of term.

Q: What is the grading scale?
A: Most programs use percentages (0–100%) and letter grades. Pass is typically ≥ 60%, but program minimums apply. Some trades use Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory. Your program syllabus details grade weightings.

Q: How is my final grade calculated?
A: Your final grade is the weighted average of course components: tests, assignments, labs, participation, etc. Details are in the course outline. GPA uses the letter grade equivalents.

Q: What if I disagree with my evaluation result?
A: Approach your instructor first to discuss specifics. If unresolved, consult your Program Chair within 10 days. If needed, lodge a formal Grade Appeal via the Registrar’s website within the time limit.

Q: Is there a limit to resubmissions?
A: There is no universal policy. Course outlines specify if resubmits or revisions are allowed and under what conditions. They may incur a grade penalty.

Q: What is a deferred evaluation?
A: Deferred evaluations are exams, assignments, or labs rescheduled if you miss the original date due to documented reasons. Faculty consults with administration and may schedule in next available exam period.

Q: When do deferred exams take place?
A: Deferred exams usually happen just after the main exam period or at later sessions identified on the Academic Calendar. Your faculty will publish dates in advance.

Q: What if faculty refuses to allow deferral?
A: You may escalate to the Associate Dean or SSA. In cases of extenuating circumstances, the SSA can request additional accommodations or permission to defer outside standard schedule.

Q: What is a “no‑show” policy?
A: Some programs have “no-show” removal rules, where missing the first day of class can result in deregistration. Always attend the first session or notify in advance if unable to attend.
