    "In this workshop, we successfully implemented a full NLP pipeline to support a student services chatbot scenario. By applying custom text preprocessing and leveraging both predictive (Word2Vec) and count-based (GloVe) embedding techniques, we extracted meaningful semantic representations of student language.\n",

    "We also developed four foundational probabilistic language models—Unigram, Bigram, Trigram, and Laplace-smoothed Bigram—to understand how words probabilistically co-occur in student support queries.\n",

    "Our comparison of Word2Vec vs GloVe revealed that Word2Vec performs better in this context due to its ability to model local contextual nuances, which are essential for chatbot accuracy and relevance.\n",

    "- Real-world text cleaning and normalization\n",
    "- Training and applying embedding models\n",
    "- Building statistical language models\n",
    "- Interpreting and comparing NLP methodologies\n",
